# Group 21 - German Vehicle Sale Trends

## Milestones

The milestones of the project represent the deliverables throughout the COSC301 term. For the purpose of submission, all work for milestone 1-3 will be merged into a single Jupyter Notebook in the analysis directory.

### Milestone 1
This milestone invloves choosing a data set for the prohect, then loading the data set into a Jupyer Notebook file.

### Milestone 2
This milestone invloves cleaning the raw data set, then performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), then crease some data visualizations, and working with method chaning in Pandas. 

### Milestone 3
This milestone is a continuation of the previous milestone; focusing on feedback provided by TA's. In addition, the data will be processed for the dashboard.

### Milestone 4

Final submission of the project, paired with a Tableau dashboard. 

## Topic of Interest: Vehicle Marketplace

The automobile marketplace is a complex space, vehicles are intricate and contain many properties that must be considered when purchasing. Ultamately, however, the most important attribute of a vehicle is the price; which gives rise to a natural question: what attribute has the greatest influence on a vehicles price? What are the weighting factors on each of the attributes of a vehicle, for instance: can a large amount of horsepower overcome high milage? Knowing what attributes of a vehicle affect its price the most gives sellers the power to appropriatly price their vehicle, and gives buyers the power to make a fair offer on a vehicle. A stength of this data set is how easily it can be translated to a user-facing dashboard. The analyzed data could be translated to a dashboard that could reflect car prices with the factored properties taken into account. Alternatively, a vehicle could be entered and the dashboard could analyze the input to recomend a price given the specifications using a model found for the weighting factors.

## Dataset Description

The data is provided by Kaggle user Ander, accessible through: [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/ander289386/cars-germany). The data is automatically scraped from popular German car marketplace AutoScout24. The data set reflects all cars listed on the website that were for sale in the German marketplace from 2011 through 2021. Each tuple of the data tells the car make, model, milage, fuel type, transmission, condition, price, horsepower, and year. The data set was originally collected to illustrate Ander's website data scraping software Zenrows.com, thus the data set is a faux advertisement.

## Jared Paull

I am an electrical engineering student, I have the slightest passion about vehicles. I am looking forward to learning about important vehicle price factors.
